# Satellite-Orbit-Analysis
## Overview
This GitHub repository provides a brief analysis of satellites orbiting Earth using Python and popular data analysis libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. The analysis covers data loading, cleaning, and visualization to gain insights into the distribution of satellites by purpose, orbit class, country of operator/owner, launch mass, and launch vehicles.
